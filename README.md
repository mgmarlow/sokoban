## Prior Art

Much of this implementation references the Harvard's CS50
[Zelda source code](https://github.com/games50/zelda), in
particular the
[`StateMachine`](https://github.com/mgmarlow/sokoban/blob/master/src/StateMachine.lua)
Class. This project also uses multiple
libraries from [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump/).
